M is a zero bootstrap php/MySQL MVC (Model View Controller) framework for rapid WEB development with php and MySQL.
Mcontroller routes and dispatches urls, and enables access to Mmodel, Mview and other facilities.
Mmodel is a collection of facilities to communicate with the MySQL database.
Mview is an extension of the Smarty class http://www.smarty.net/


M.jar for Android is a resource-less approach to frameworking Android applications.
It is mostly a translation of PHP M to the java Android environment.
In tandem with PHP M, it is easy to construct independent cloud based applications.
